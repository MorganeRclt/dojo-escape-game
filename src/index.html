          numerous years. While you are looking for your next diving, you find a mysterious article
          about the wreck of the SS President Coolidge. This boat has sunk during the World War II near the Vanuatu, 
          in South Pacific Ocean. And according to its author, a treasure would be hidden in one of the boat's room: the
          Lady Room ! <br>
          You love adventure, so you pack your equipment and fly to Vanuatu. <br>
          You dive, find the wreck and begin to look for the Lady Room. You enter in what looks like
          the captain's office. This is not the right room, so you try to go out, but the door you came in through is blocked ! <br>
          You must quickly find another exit, because you have just enough oxygen in your bottle
          for the next 45 minutes ! <br>
